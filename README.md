# chatbot-chatgptapi

A chatbot for a travel agent company. There are two parts to work in sync when the chatbot interacts with a user: a front-end user interface client and a backend ChatGPT-based server.

A web-based interface to receive travel related questions from users, like inquiring the distance or flight time between two cities or the travel package options from Mumbai or Hong Kong to London.

Questions inquiring, for example, the distance or flight time between two cities can be answered by the direct use of ChatGPT. On the other hand, the types and costs of packages varies from travel agent to travel agent, so backend maintain a travel agent specific database containing information about travel package options, costs, etc.
